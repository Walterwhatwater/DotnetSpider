	/// One Lock Bounded Blocking Queue (e.g. Bounded Buffer).
	/// This queue is internally synchronized (thread-safe)
	/// and designed for one-many producers and one-many
	/// consumer threads.  This is ideal for pipelining
	/// or other consumer/producer needs.
	/// Fast and thread safe on single or multiple cpu machines.
	/// 
	/// Consumer thread(s) will block on Dequeue operations
	/// until another thread performs a Enqueue
	/// operation, at which point the first scheduled consumer
	/// thread will be unblocked and get the
	/// current object.  Producer thread(s) will block
	/// on Enqueue operations until another
	/// consumer thread calls Dequeue to free a queue slot,
	/// at which point the first scheduled producer
	/// thread will be unblocked to finish its Enqueue operation.
	/// No user code is needed to
	/// handle this "ping-pong" between locking/unlocking
	/// consumers and producers.
